## Basic OAuth App
This app is a basic proof of concept that will display a page that uses Keycloak to authenticate users.

Run `npm install && npm run dev` in order to spin up the service. Keycloak will not be spun up automatically, so if you would like to 
test full functionality, follow [this guide](https://www.keycloak.org/getting-started/getting-started-docker).
